BLD-MAXIMA translates Lisp math expressions into Maxima lisp-level
expressions, and uses embeddable-maxima's "simplify" function to
simplify them. The simplified Maxima lisp expressions are then
translated back into Lisp math expressions. Lisp forms that aren't
translated are treated as symbols in Maxima.

Depends on embeddable-maxima for an ASDF loadable Maxima library:
https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/embeddable-maxima

Depends on cl-ppcre for translating Lisp -> Maxima -> Lisp.

Tests in BLD-MAXIMA-TESTS use fiveam.

Usage
=====

CL-USER> (asdf:load-system 'bld-maxima)
CL-USER> (bld-maxima:simp '(+ (aref a 2) (aref a 2)))
(* 2 (AREF A 2))

simp-exprs
==========

The 'simp-exprs function takes a series of math expressions as
arguments and simplifies all of them with one call to Maxima instead
of several.

delay
=====

Wrapping the 'delay' macro around a 'simp expression prevents
evaluation so it can be deferred until later, which can speed
computations in certain circumstances because of the overhead incurred
by 'simp.
