BLD-MAXIMA calls Maxima to evaluate Maxima or Maxima lisp-level expressions.
It includes translation of Lisp math expressions to Maxima for algebraic simplification.
Lisp forms that aren't in the translation table are identified and treated as symbols in Maxima.
Depends on KMRCL for COMMAND-OUTPUT to run Maxima & get output.
Depends on CL-PPCRE for translating Lisp -> Maxima -> Lisp.
Exports *maxima-binary*, *maxima-batch-options*, and SIMPLIFY-LISP-EXPR.

Usage:
CL-USER> (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'bld-maxima)
CL-USER> (bld-maxima:simplify-lisp-expr '(+ (aref a 2) (aref a 2)))
(* 2 (AREF A 2))
